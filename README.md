# Dual-Channel-Signal-Generator

Project Summary:
• Programmed the FPGA using Verilog to produce waveform signals of various frequencies, amplitude, duty cycle and displayed them on the oscilloscope. 
• Dual Channel operation to display two waveforms which could be controlled individually and simultaneously.

Design Specifications:

•	Amplitude resolution : 1 digital bit (Step size can be changed to 10, 100 and 1000)
•	Frequency range of waveforms : 1 Hz – 10 KHz
•	Frequency resolution : 1Hz (Step size can be changed to 10, 100 and 1000)
•	Waveforms : Square, Triangle and Sine
•	Duty cycle : 1% - 100%
•	Duty cycle resolution: 1% (Step size can be change to 10)  
•	Responsiveness of less than 0.5 seconds
